# ProvaFinaleAPI2021

Repository for the final project of API 2021. It contains code and tools for working with graph ranking.

## Contents
- **docs/**: Project documentation.
- **open_tests/**: Example tests.
- **testcase_generator/**: Scripts to create test cases.
- **FinalGraphRanker.c**: Main code.

## Project Goals
The project aims to:
- Implement an algorithm for graph ranking.
- Develop an efficient system to analyze and compare graphs.
- Provide tools to automatically generate and test case studies.

## Getting Started
1. Compile the main file:
   ```
   gcc -o FinalGraphRanker FinalGraphRanker.c
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   ./FinalGraphRanker
   ```

You can customize the input data according to the project's needs.

## Notes
Project developed for the exam of Algorithms and Principles of Computer Science (2021) at PoliMi.
